{"id":"62","title":"Java: Null check necessity","text":"Java methods on object references will throw a `NullPointerException` if the object is `null`. Always check if an object is `null` before calling any method on it, or use Java 8's `Optional` for safer handling."}

{"id":"64","title":"Python: Safe attribute access","text":"To prevent `AttributeError` when a variable might be `None` (a common `NoneType` bug), use an explicit check: `if obj is not None:`. If cleaning user input, ensure it's not `None` before calling `.strip()` or similar methods."}
{"id":"65","title":"Guarding Division by Zero","text":"In most languages (Python, Java, C++), dividing an integer by zero causes an exception (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `ArithmeticException`). Always add an `if` condition to check if the divisor is zero before performing the operation."}

{"id":"70","title":"C++: Memory Allocation and Deallocation","text":"Every use of `new` for a single object requires a corresponding `delete`. Every use of `new[]` for an array requires a corresponding `delete[]`. Failing to deallocate leads to memory leaks, degrading application performance."}
{"id":"71","title":"C++: Smart Pointers","text":"In modern C++, prefer smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` over raw pointers. Smart pointers automatically manage memory deallocation via RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), effectively eliminating most manual memory leaks."}
{"id":"72","title":"SQL Injection Prevention","text":"Never build SQL queries by string concatenation, especially with unvalidated user input. Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements** provided by your database driver to separate the SQL code from the user data."}
{"id":"73","title":"Python: Safe SQL Queries","text":"Use placeholder syntax (`%s` for old style, or `?` or named placeholders) with your database connector's `cursor.execute()` method to pass user input as data, preventing SQL injection attacks."}
{"id":"74","title":"Logic: Infinite Loops","text":"An infinite loop occurs when the loop's termination condition is never met. Ensure that the loop counter or the state variable used in the `while` or `for` condition is modified correctly (e.g., incremented or decremented) within the loop body."}
{"id":"75","title":"Python: Fixing Infinite Loops","text":"In a `while` loop that iterates over a list index, ensure the index variable (`i` in your case) is incremented on every iteration using `i += 1` to prevent the condition from remaining perpetually true, thus avoiding an infinite loop."}
